    "input": "When examining the given passage, it describes how the settler aims to convert the Natives into Christians and strip them of their culture by gradually integrating the Natives into their colonies. The settler also suggests the use of violent control if the Natives resist cooperation. The new lands in the Americas offered Europeans abundant resources and opportunities, which they planned to exploit to gain wealth. Alongside, they intended to spread their influence through religious conversions. Answer B essentially summarizes the goals of European settlers. \"Discourse of Western Planting\" is a document (written by Richard Hakluyt) urging the English Crown to invest more in new colonies, as the Spaniards were profiting greatly from their own. Spain and England were rivals, particularly in establishing territories in the New World. However, this excerpt deals with general European attitudes and objectives regarding the Natives and the Americas, not competition between European nations. Thus, you can safely disregard this answer. As mentioned earlier, the Americas' diverse terrain was rich in valuable resources, which would alter economic systems in the Western Hemisphere. Nonetheless, this excerpt does not address feudalism and capitalism, focusing instead on resource extraction and converting the Natives. Africans are not mentioned in this excerpt, so eliminate answer D immediately. 4. Which of the following effects of European colonization is foreshadowed by the excerpt?\nOptions:\nA Maryland\u2019s 1649 act promoting tolerance for Christians who believed in the holy trinity\nB inflation of European economies due to the influx of colonial silver\nC the decimation of Native American populations by smallpox\nD Pueblo Indians\u2019 1680 rebellion against Spanish rule",

This diode, in effect, cuts the power delivered to the filament by about half because\nOptions:\nA the diode halves the voltage of the current passing through the light bulb so that the power it receives is also halved.\nB the diode behaves like a filament so that there are two filaments in a series, with each of them receiving half the power that a single filament would receive.\nC the diode divides the current in half and only allows one half of that current to flow through the filament.\nD the diode only allows current to flow in one direction so that during one half of each cycle of the AC power line, no current flows through the light bulb.",
